'''
Jinxin Meng, 20240312
Generate the profile to determinethe presence or absence of KO in each sample.
All genes in each gene cluster were regarded have same name annotation.
Like KO, CAZyme, COGs ... annotation were used in this script.
Example out:
name    s1  s2  s3 ...
K00001  1   4   2       
K00002  2   1   1
K00003  1   2   3
...
Required files:
1. KO annotation with field gene name and KO name with "\t" or "\s" delimited
2. gene cluster relationship provided by mmseqs
